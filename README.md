<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved implementing a digital solution to streamline waste reduction submissions and approvals across Kansanshi. The system facilitated structured input collection, automated approval workflows, and integrated finance verification to ensure accurate tracking of cost-saving initiatives. A Power BI report was developed to provide real-time insights into waste reduction efforts, enabling data-driven decision-making. Additionally, a series of workshops and collaborative sessions were conducted to identify and develop cost-saving opportunities, fostering cross-functional engagement and process integration across various departments.
